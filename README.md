My journey to Artificial Intelligence 

 |Algorithm | Remark | Date | Link |
 |--- | --- | --- | --- |
|Linear Regression with one variable | My first Machine Learning algorithm implementation from scratch. Feeling very happy | 6/9/18 | [Link](/Linear%20Regression%20with%20one%20variable.ipynb)|
|Multivariate Linear Regression | Linear Regression with multiple variable implemented using matrix operations | 5/10/18 | [Link](/Multivariate%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)|
|Regression with catagorical feature | Linear Regression with a dataset having catagorical feature | 5/10/18 | [Link](/Linear%20Regression%20with%20Catagorical%20Features.ipynb)|
|Logistic Regression | Linear Regression (Binary classification) | 8/10/18 | [Link](Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)|
|Multiclass Logistic Regression | One vs All method | 22/10/18 | [Link](Multiclass%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)|
|K Nearest Neibhbors | KNN for classification. before 2 hours I started learning it. and by now, it's implemented. It's easy | 31/10/18 | [Link](KNN.ipynb)|
|Neural Network Forward propagation | Forword propagation for prediction in NN with given weights  | 12/11/18 | [Link](Neural%20Network%20Forward%20Propogation.ipynb)|
|Backpropagation Algorithm | Backpropagation algorithm for Neural Network learnig. It took lot of time because I was trying to implement it from wrong details. with right description, It took just one night to do it. It's funtestic. | 26/11/18 | [Link](Backpropagation%20Algorithm.ipynb)|
